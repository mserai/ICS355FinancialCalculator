# ICS355FinancialCalculator
I created this project using Netbeans because it allowed me to create a database through the IDE. The code connects to the database called Accounts with the table called Users. Running the file ICS355ProgAssignment2.java imports the database using the admin account named serai with password adminpass. From there you are prompted if you would like to login to the existing program, or create a new account which will update the database. On subsequent runs you can continue you add/delete users to your delight.
