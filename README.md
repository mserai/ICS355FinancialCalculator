# ICS355FinancialCalculator
I created this project using jGrasp. As opposed to using commandline arguments I have the user creating a file that they can continue to overwrite as they add different amounts. I utilized some of my older code from ICS 211 that dealt with reading, manipulating and writing csv files in order to kind of get me on track. One example is that the user creates a .txt file called mike.txt. The user decides not to add or subtract anything from their empty account, and a default save writes to their file so they can continue to use the same file later on. Once the user decides to add something, their balance will appear. The user can then continue to manipulate that data and view their account in different currencies.
